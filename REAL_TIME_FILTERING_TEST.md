# Real-Time Filtering Test Cases

## Implementation Overview

Added smart optimistic updates that immediately show/hide transactions based on current filter state when department assignments change.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. ✅ Unassigned Filter Active + Assign Department
**Setup**: Filter by "Unassigned" to show only unassigned transactions
**Action**: Assign a transaction to "Rolling" department  
**Expected**: Transaction immediately disappears from view
**Reason**: Transaction is no longer unassigned, so it doesn't match the "Unassigned" filter

### 2. ✅ Department Filter Active + Assign Same Department  
**Setup**: Filter by "Rolling" department
**Action**: Assign an unassigned transaction to "Rolling" department
**Expected**: Transaction stays visible with updated department label
**Reason**: Transaction now matches the "Rolling" filter

### 3. ✅ Department Filter Active + Assign Different Department
**Setup**: Filter by "Rolling" department  
**Action**: Change a transaction from "Rolling" to "Marketing" department
**Expected**: Transaction immediately disappears from view
**Reason**: Transaction no longer matches the "Rolling" filter

### 4. ✅ No Filter Active + Any Assignment
**Setup**: Show all transactions (no department filter)
**Action**: Assign/reassign any transaction to any department
**Expected**: Transaction stays visible with updated department label
**Reason**: No filter restrictions, so all transactions remain visible

### 5. ✅ Multiple Filters Active
**Setup**: Filter by "Rolling" department + specific bank + date range
**Action**: Change department assignment 
**Expected**: Transaction disappears only if department no longer matches, regardless of other filters
**Reason**: All filters must be satisfied for transaction to remain visible

### 6. ✅ Assign to Unassigned
**Setup**: Filter by "Unassigned"
**Action**: Remove department assignment (set to unassigned)
**Expected**: Transaction stays visible 
**Reason**: Transaction now matches the "Unassigned" filter

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions Added:

1. **`transactionMatchesFilters(transaction)`**:
   - Checks if a transaction matches all current filter criteria
   - Handles bank, department, search term, and date range filters
   - Uses same logic as server-side filtering for consistency

2. **Enhanced `handleDepartmentChange`**:
   - Creates updated transaction with new department
   - Checks if updated transaction still matches current filters
   - Removes transaction from view if it no longer matches
   - Keeps transaction visible if it still matches

### Filter Matching Logic:
- **Department Filter**: Exact match for department names, special handling for "Unassigned"
- **Bank Filter**: Exact bank name matching
- **Search Filter**: Numeric search matches amounts, text search matches descriptions
- **Date Filter**: Transaction date falls within specified range

## Expected User Experience:

1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**: No delay between assignment and visual update
2. **Consistent Filtering**: View always shows only transactions matching current filters  
3. **Smooth Interactions**: No jarring page reloads or data refetching
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Users can expect transactions to appear/disappear logically

## Technical Benefits:

- **Performance**: No server roundtrips for immediate UI updates
- **Responsiveness**: Instant feedback improves user experience
- **Consistency**: Local filtering logic matches server-side logic
- **Reliability**: Optimistic updates with proper error handling
