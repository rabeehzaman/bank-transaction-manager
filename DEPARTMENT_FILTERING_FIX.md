# Department Filtering Fix

## Issue Description

User created a "Rolling" department and assigned transactions to it, but when filtering by "Rolling" department, no transactions appeared.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **missing database infrastructure**:

1. **Missing RPC Functions**: The frontend was calling RPC functions that didn't exist in the database:
   - `assign_department_to_transaction` ❌
   - `remove_department_assignment` ❌  
   - `bulk_assign_department` ❌

2. **Incomplete View Structure**: The `frontend_transactions_view` may not have been properly structured to join department information.

3. **Data Flow Breakdown**:
   ```
   Frontend assigns "Rolling" → RPC function (missing) → No database update
   Frontend filters by "Rolling" → View query → No matching records found
   ```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing RPC Functions (Migration 004)

**`assign_department_to_transaction`**:
- Generates `content_hash` for transaction identification
- Stores department assignment in `transaction_tags` table
- Links department ID to transaction hash
- Handles both new records and updates

**`remove_department_assignment`**:
- Removes department assignment from transaction
- Cleans up empty records to maintain data integrity

**`bulk_assign_department`**:
- Allows batch assignment of multiple transactions
- Returns count of affected records

### 2. Fixed Department View Structure (Migration 005)

**Enhanced `frontend_transactions_view`**:
- Properly joins `transaction_tags` with `departments` table
- Returns department name for filtering
- Returns department ID for assignments
- Includes manual descriptions

### 3. Database Schema Verification

**Transaction Tags Table**:
```sql
transaction_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_id TEXT,           -- content_hash from transactions
    source_department TEXT,        -- department UUID as text
    manual_description TEXT,       -- manual descriptions  
    notes TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Department Join Logic**:
```sql
LEFT JOIN transaction_tags tags ON transaction.content_hash = tags.transaction_id
LEFT JOIN departments dept ON tags.source_department = dept.id::TEXT
```

## Expected Result After Fix

1. **Department Assignment**: 
   - User assigns transaction to "Rolling" → RPC function executes → Database updated ✅

2. **Department Filtering**:
   - User filters by "Rolling" → View returns matching records ✅

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Assignments survive data re-uploads (stored in separate `transaction_tags` table) ✅

## Migration Files Created

- **`004_create_missing_rpc_functions.sql`**: Creates all missing RPC functions
- **`005_create_frontend_transactions_view.sql`**: Ensures proper view structure

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migrations**: Run the migration files in your Supabase database
2. **Test Assignment**: Assign a transaction to "Rolling" department
3. **Test Filtering**: Filter by "Rolling" department to verify transactions appear
4. **Verify Persistence**: Confirm assignments survive data operations

## Implementation Notes

- **Content Hash**: Uses SHA256 hash of transaction data for consistent identification
- **Department Storage**: Stores department UUID in `transaction_tags.source_department`  
- **View Joins**: Properly resolves department names for frontend consumption
- **Error Handling**: All RPC functions include comprehensive error handling
- **Permissions**: All functions granted to both authenticated and anonymous users

The fix addresses both the immediate filtering issue and establishes proper infrastructure for reliable department management.
